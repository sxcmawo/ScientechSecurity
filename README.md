This project is a part of a solution proposed by the team "Scientech" for the "SheCodes 2.0" hackathon's InDrive case.

The repository holds the computer vision model to detect special sign and send emergency messages. 
It also has a simulation implemented using javascript to demonstrate the feature when a driver goes beyond specific area during a trip and an emergency message is sent.
